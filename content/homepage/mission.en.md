Contribute to the development within a city of a cooperative model integrating the principles of the commons*, groups of small farmers on productive urban agricultural land and integrated into local consumption habits to support a healthy food system.

_\* (the commons neither private nor public, we speak of commons when a group takes charge and takes care of the management of collective resources for the good of all its members)_
