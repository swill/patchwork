1. Allow access to groups of small agricultural producers to agricultural land to implement organic, ecologically responsible and sustainable agriculture with techniques and practices of cultivation, conservation and soil regeneration adapted to small areas
1. Develop a cooperative mutual aid system based on bringing together small projects in order to benefit from the synergy effect (taking everyone's strengths and remedying everyone's weaknesses) to manage a common resource
1. Create opportunities. Allow the nearby population to have access to healthy, nutritious, locally produced products from the land at affordable prices by using the land to feed the local population
1. Community engagement: sharing the knowledge of urban farmers with the population through workshops, trainings, information day, community events and celebration (garlic day, harvest festival, ...)
